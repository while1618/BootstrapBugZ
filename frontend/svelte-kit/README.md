# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered
by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

create `.env` file in root of svelte-kit directory with the following data:

```bash
# Public
PUBLIC_APP_NAME=BootstrapBugZ
PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8081/v1
# Private
JWT_SECRET=secret
```

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install`
or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for
> your target environment.

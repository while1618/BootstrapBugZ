## Project Structure

### Backend

The backend follows a typical Spring Boot structure with a clear organization into the following main directories:

- **auth**: Contains authentication and authorization logic.
- **user**: Contains user related logic.
- **admin**: Contains admin related logic - user management.
- **shared**: Includes shared utilities, services, configs and components used across different modules.
- **resources**: Standard Spring Boot resources directory for configuration files, static assets, and templates.

The **test** directory mirrors this structure, ensuring tests are organized alongside the corresponding features.

### Frontend

- **messages**: Stores internationalization (i18n) files for multilingual support.
- **src/routes**: Files here represent the routes of the web application, aligning with the file-based routing paradigm of SvelteKit.
- **src/lib**: This directory contains reusable logic and components, organized into:
  - **components**: UI components and building blocks.
  - **models**: Data models and interfaces.
  - **server**: Server-side utilities or APIs used by the frontend.
  - **utils**: Various utility functions available at the root of `lib` directory.

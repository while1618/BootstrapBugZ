## üîß Continuous Integration (CI)

### üëÄ Overview

GitHub Actions is used for Continuous Integration (CI). You'll find the workflow files in the `.github/workflows` directory:

- **`spring-boot.yml`**: Run linting, unit and integration tests for Spring Boot API.
- **`svelte-kit.yml`**: Run linting, unit and integration tests for SvelteKit UI.
- **`docs.yml`**: Run linting for the docs.

The workflows are automatically triggered when changes are made to the corresponding directories. You can also trigger them manually via the GitHub Actions interface.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

The `svelte-kit.yml` workflow requires the following environment variables:

These should be added as **variables** in the settings of your repo, under **Secrets and variables > Actions**:

```bash
PUBLIC_APP_NAME=your_app_name
PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
```

This should be added as a **secret** in the settings of your repo, under **Secrets and variables > Actions**:

```bash
JWT_SECRET=secret
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running Workflows Manually

To manually trigger any workflow:

1. Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your repository.
2. Select the desired workflow (e.g., `spring-boot.yml`, `svelte-kit.yml`, or `docs.yml`).
3. Click the **Run workflow** button.

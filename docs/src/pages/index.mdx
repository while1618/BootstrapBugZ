# bugzkit

bugzkit is a production-ready web application template designed to handle essential web app functionalities.
Developers can focus on business logic while using this template as a robust starting point.

## Overview

This project is not a no-code solution, nor is it just another SaaS boilerplate stuffed with third-party integrations.
It's designed specifically for experienced developers who want complete control over their applications.
You'll need to understand the written code, which is entirely yours to adapt, extend, and own.

The goal is to provide a reliable and customizable foundation that eliminates repetitive setup tasks, letting you focus entirely on crafting your unique business logic.

bugzkit includes features like:

- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with role-based user access implemented in Spring Boot.
- **Admin Panel**: Admin panel for handling users.
- **Error Handling**: Standardized error codes and error handling mechanisms.
- **i18n**: Internationalization (i18n) support for multi language applications.
- **Email Support**: Sending emails from backend with [MJML](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml) template emails.
- **Logging**: A comprehensive logging and monitoring system for easier debugging and tracking.

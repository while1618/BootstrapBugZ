## Using

### Prerequisites

To use `bugzkit` ensure you have the following software installed:

- [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Java 21](https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/21/)
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
- [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

### Initialize Your Project

Go to a [bugzkit repo](https://github.com/while1618/bugzkit), click on a `Use this template` button (you need to be logged in on github for this button to appear).
Once you created your repo, clone it and run the initialization script:

```bash
./init.sh
```

The script will:

1. Ask for your project name.
2. Replace all instances of `bugzkit` with your project name.
3. Remove unnecessary files and folders, including the script itself.
4. Ask if you want to keep the docs or not.

Once completed, commit the changes and start coding!

## Running the Backend

### Running Locally

For the API to start properly, you'll need Postgres and Redis running. The easies way to that is via `docker-compose-db-dev.yml` file in the `backend` directory:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-db-dev.yml up -d
```

After the services are up and running, start the application:

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```

Alternatively, use IntelliJ IDEA. A pre-configured run configuration is available - just click and run!

### Running via Docker

For running the API using Docker, execute:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-api-dev.yml up --build -d
```

**Note**: Email functionalities (e.g., account confirmation, password reset) won't work without configuring SMTP. Check the Environment Variables section for the setup.

## Running the Frontend

Ensure the API is up and running before starting the UI. Then, create a `.env` file in the root of the frontend directory with the following content:

```bash
# Public
PUBLIC_APP_NAME=your_app_name
PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080/v1
# Private
JWT_SECRET=secret
```

To start the UI, run:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

You're all set!

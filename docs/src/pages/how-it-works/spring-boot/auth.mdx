## Auth

### Sign In

When a user signs in, two tokens are created: **Access Token**, **Refresh Token**

Both tokens are sent to the user in the response body and consumed by the SvelteKit frontend. This document focuses on the backend side of authentication.
For more details on the frontend implementation, refer to the Svelte Kit section of the docs.

#### Token Usage

- **Access Token** is used to access protected resources within the app.
- **Refresh Token** is used to silently obtain a new access token when the current one expires, allowing the user to stay signed in without re-entering their password.

The access token is not stored in the database, while the refresh token is stored in Redis.

#### Token Expiration

- **Access Token**: Valid for 15 minutes.
- **Refresh Token**: Valid for 7 days.

You can change these values through environment variables.

#### Refresh Token Rotation

When a user requests a new access and refresh token, both are regenerated.
This is called **refresh token rotation** and ensures old refresh tokens are no longer valid.
For more details, see [Auth0's docs on refresh token rotation](https://auth0.com/docs/secure/tokens/refresh-tokens/refresh-token-rotation).

### Sign Out

When a user signs out:

1. Tokens are removed from HTTP-only cookies on the frontend.
2. The refresh token is deleted from Redis.
3. The access token is blacklisted in Redis.

#### Why Blacklist Access Tokens?

JWTs cannot be invalidated directly. Removing them from cookies is not enough since the tokens remain valid until they expire.
Blacklisting ensures they can no longer be used. Blacklisted access tokens are stored for a maximum of 15 minutes (the access token's lifetime),
after which they are no longer needed.

### Sign Out from All Devices

When a user signs out from all devices:

- The user's ID and the time of the request are stored in Redis.
- All tokens created before the sign-out request are invalid.

Again, this data will only be stored in Redis for the access token lifetime (15 minutes).

### Account Verification

When a user signs up, a JWT with the purpose `verify_email_token` is created and sent to the user via email as part of a verification link.

### Password Reset

When a user requests a password reset, a JWT with the purpose `reset_password` is generated and sent to the user via email as part of a reset link.

### JWT Structure

All JWTs have the same structure:

- **issuer**: Who created the token.
- **issuedAt**: When the token was created.
- **expireAt**: When the token expires.
- **purpose**: The token's purpose (`access_token`, `refresh_token`, `reset_password_token`, `verify_email_token`).

Access and refresh tokens include one additional claim, **roles** that represents the roles assigned to the user.

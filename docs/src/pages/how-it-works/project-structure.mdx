## 📂 Project Structure

### 🖥️ Backend

The backend follows a typical Spring Boot structure with a clear organization into the following main directories:

- **admin**: Handles administrative functionality and management features.
- **auth**: Contains authentication and authorization logic.
- **user**: Manages user-related features and endpoints.
- **shared**: Includes shared utilities, services, or components used across different modules.
- **resources**: Standard Spring Boot resources directory for configuration files, static assets, and templates.

The test directory mirrors this structure, ensuring tests are organized alongside the corresponding features.

### 🌐 Frontend

The frontend is built using SvelteKit and adheres to its standard project structure. Key directories include:

- **messages**: Located at the root level, this directory stores internationalization (i18n) files for multilingual support.
- **src/routes**: Files here represent the routes of the web application, aligning with the file-based routing paradigm of SvelteKit.
- **src/lib**: This directory contains reusable logic and components, organized into:
  - **components**: UI components and building blocks.
  - **models**: Data models and interfaces.
  - **server**: Server-side utilities or APIs used by the frontend.
  - **utils**: Various utility functions available at the root of `lib`.

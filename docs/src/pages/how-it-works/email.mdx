## Email

Sending emails requires additional setup and won't work out of the box.
You'll need to configure your SMTP settings, including the host, username, and password.
You can set these up directly in the code or via environment variables. Refer to the corresponding section for more details.

## HTML Emails

You can create HTML email templates in the `resources/templates` directory and send them using the `sendHtmlEmail()` method from the `EmailService`.
However, creating responsive emails can be challenging.

To simplify this, I've integrated [MJML](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml).
To use it, create a `.mjml` file in the `resources/templates` directory.
During the `mvn compile` phase, the `mjml` CLI will automatically generate the corresponding HTML email for you.
